# Drobo-Status
This is a simple python script that will run a flask container to pull data from Drobo. It will give information like (Name, serial, firmware, disk-total, disk-used, disk-free and individual disk status).  I have an older Drobo FS 8 disk array. Please let me know if anyone can test. The results are outputted via JSON
